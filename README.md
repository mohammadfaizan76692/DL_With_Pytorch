Hey, guys this repository contains Models of Deep learning that are implemented in Pytorch
## First Demo contains things like
Tensor

Dimensions in Torch

Cuda

torch.arrange()

Squeezed

unsqueezed

Tensors to NumPy array

NumPy to Tensor array 
___________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
## Second Demo Contains Pytorch Workflow for any Model

Here I simply implement Linear Regression ( y=w*x +b) where w is weights and b is the bias term, 

I create a Manual dataset by Defining the weights and bias.

Use this manual data set to apply regression 

Visualize how Test loss and Training loss decrease  with epochs, And how the predictions change with epochs.

### Pytorch Workflow for any Model 

1. Data Preparation
2. Building Model
3. Fitting the Model to Data (Training)
4. Making predictions and Evaluating the Model
5. Improve With Experiments
6. Saving And Loading a Model
7. Putting it all Together

### Visualization of how predictions of Test Sets change with epochs.
